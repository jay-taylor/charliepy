:math:`\phi`-Conjugacy Classes
==============================

Let us recall that the automorphism `\phi` induces a natural equivalence
relation on the group `W`, which we call `\phi`-conjugacy. In
particular, we say two elements `x,y \in W` are `\phi`-conjugate
if there exists an element `z \in W` such that

.. math:: x = z^{-1}y\phi(z).

The equivalence classes under this relation are known as the
`\phi`-conjugacy classes of `W`.

.. admonition:: Definition

    We say `C \subset W\phi` is a `\phi`-conjugacy class if any
    one of the following equivalent conditions is satisfied:

    * `C` is a `W`-orbit under the natural conjugation action of `W` on
      `W\phi`.
    * `C` is a conjugacy class of `\widetilde{W}` contained in the
      coset `W\phi`.
    * the set `\{w \in W \mid (w, \phi) \in C\}` is a `\phi`-conjugacy
      class of `W`.

The following function will produce the `\phi`-conjugacy classes of any
Coxeter coset.
