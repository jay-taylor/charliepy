Welcome
=======
CharLiePy is a python package which implements algorithms to carry out symbolic
computations with Coxeter groups and related mathematical structures. It may be
considered as a Python version of the original `CHEVIE`_ package which was
written in `GAP3`_ and MAPLE. People familiar with CHEVIE will be quite at home
using CharLiePy but a knowledge of CHEVIE is not necessary to use the software.

Citing CharLiePy
----------------
If you use CharLiePy as part of a research project then you can of course also
cite this documentation as a reference point for CharLiePy.  If you have used
CharLiePy for some research then please tell us about it by contacting one of
the contributors!

Why Python?
-----------
One of the original reasons for choosing Python as the language for CharLiePy is
the success of the `Sage <http://www.sagemath.org/>`_ project. In particular,
CharLiePy may be used in Sage by simply importing CharLiePy in an interactive
session. Here are some additional reasons:

* Python is very popular with the wider scientific community (see for instance
  the `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ project).

* It is easy to encorporate C extensions into Python, thus allowing one to
  obtain speed advantages when needed.

* As Python is a widely used modern programming language, anyone learning to use
  CharLiePy for research will simultaneously gain a useful transferable skill.

* The Python language is syntactically similar to the `GAP3`_ language, on which
  the original CHEVIE package was based. Thus it should not be difficult for
  people to switch between the two languages.
