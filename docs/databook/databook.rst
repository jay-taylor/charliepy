=========

Many algorithms in PyCox reduce a problem to the case of irreducible root
systems and then run specialised algorithms for that particular case. Thus
much of the data in PyCox depends upon the irreducible root systems.

In this section of the documentation we keep track of our assumptions and
conventions for each irreducible type. For example, here it is described our
conventions for the labellings of irreducible characters and conjugacy classes
of these groups.

The sections are listed using the familiar classification of irreducible root
systems. A number preceeding a type denotes that we consider an automorphism
of the root system of that order.
